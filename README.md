# AI-Voice-Assistant-System-Jarvis-

This project is an advanced AI voice assistant system inspired by Jarvis, designed to handle over 1,000 daily user interactions with a high response accuracy of 95%. Built using Python, TensorFlow, the OpenAI API, and Google Speech API, it seamlessly integrates real-time speech recognition with GPT-based language models to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses. A custom wake-word detection module was developed and optimized with neural networks, achieving 95% accuracy for reliable, hands-free activation. The system combines cutting-edge NLP and speech processing technologies to provide a fast, interactive, and highly adaptive voice interface.
